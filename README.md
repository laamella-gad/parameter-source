# parameter-source

A Â¡Laamella Gad! production.

## What problem does this solve?

Reading configuration parameters during application startup is often a little messy, leading to unnecessary long debugging times.
This tiny library wants to make it a solid experience.

Perceived problems are:
- sloppy null handling leading to confusing null pointer exceptions down the road
- sloppy type conversions (string to int, for example) leading to undescriptive errors
- sloppy file handling when we are dealing with a configuration file leading to undescriptive errors
- messy API's, different for every source of parameters
- arcane implementations making unit testing difficult

Offered solutions are:
- an API that has methods that will either fail when a required parameter is missing, or will deliver a Java 8 Optional when the parameter is not required
- file handling and type conversion work as tight as possible.
If a parameter is correct, it will be delivered, otherwise it will throw an exception so that an application does not start in an undefined state.
- tight support for the kind of values that are often seen as application parameters: strings, durations, urls...
- one approach to API naming and much reuse, so that parameter sources will look alike as much as possible.
Extending a class to define your own source is easy.

## Adding the dependency

Put this in your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.laamella</groupId>
	<artifactId>parameter-source</artifactId>
	<version>0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Using a properties file as the source

This is the simplest way to start using a properties file as a source of parameters.
```java
PropertiesParameterSource source = new PropertiesParameterSource("application.properties");
```
Other constructor offer more flexibility.

## Using a database as the source

This is the simplest way to start using a database table as a source of parameters,
specifying the JDBC database properties and the significant properties of your parameter table.
```java
JdbcDatabaseParameterSource source = new JdbcDatabaseParameterSource("jdbc:h2:mem:db", "user", "passwd", "CONFIGURATION", "KEY", "VALUE");
```
Other constructor offer more flexibility.

## Using Java's Preferences API as the source

This is the simplest way to get access to the Preferences API.
```java
PreferencesParameterSource source = new PreferencesParameterSource();
```
Please read the Javadoc for some limitations on this implementation.

## Using JNDI as the source

This is the simplest way to start using JNDI as a source of parameters.
```java
JndiParameterSource source = new JndiParameterSource();
```
You may want to pass an InitialContext to the constructor instead.

## Using a static parameter source

This stores the key-value pairs in memory and can be used as a fallback for other sources,
or for testing.
```java
InMemoryStringParameterSource source = new InMemoryStringParameterSource()
    .put("abc", "def")
    .put("ghi", "jkl");
```
Another option is to use the `InMemoryObjectParameterSource` which retrieves values without doing string conversions.

## Getting an optional string value
Getters that mention "Optional" in their name are optional.
This is implemented with Java 8's `Optional` class.
You can use it to supply a default value.
```java
Optional<String> value = source.getOptionalString("abc");
String value = source.getOptionalString("abc").orElse("myDefaultVal");
```

## Getting a required string value
Getters that do NOT mention "Optional" in their name are required.
These will throw a `ParameterSourceException` when the key is not found.
```java
String value = source.getString("abc");
```

## Getting other values

The pattern described above for string is the same for other types.

## Type conversions

In general the sources will spend some effort to convert a value to the type the user requests.
In sources that inherit from `StringParameterSource` these conversions will consist of parsing the string value in some way.
In sources that inherit from `ObjectParameterSource` there is more chance of an exact type match which requires no conversions,
but if the type of the value does not match the required type, some conversions will still be attempted.

### The duration format

When requesting a duration, we get the string value for the key, then attempt to parse it as follows:

ISO 8601 inspired:
```
1D2H3M4S5MS6NS -> 1 day + 2 hours + 3 minutes + 4 seconds + 5 milliseconds + 6 nanoseconds
1d2h3m4s5ms6ns -> the same
1d 2h 3m 4s 5ms 6ns -> the same
1d -> 1 day
1000ms -> 1000 milliseconds
3m 10s -> 3 minutes + 10 seconds
```

Traditional time format inspired:
```
12:14:16.1234 -> 12 hours + 14 minutes + 16 seconds + 123.4 milliseconds
14:16 -> 14 minutes + 16 seconds
16 -> 16 seconds
```

### The enum format

Enums values are case insensitive,
and underscores, whitespace, and quotations marks are ignored.

## Reducing repetition in keys

Often keys are (or emulate) a path.
For example: properties files use dots as separators, JNDI uses slashes.
To avoid having to specify the same paths over and over again, we can make `SubParameterSource`s.

Here is an example for dealing with a good old log4j.properties file:

```
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out
```

```java
PropertiesParameterSource source = new PropertiesParameterSource("log4j.properties");
SubParameterSource log4j = source.subSource("log4j");
log4j.getString("rootLogger"); // INFO, stdout

SubParameterSource stdoutAppender = log4j.subSource("appender.stdout");
stdoutAppender.getString(""); // org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
stdoutAppender.getString("Target"); // System.out
```

## Chaining sources

Sources can be chained so that parameters that come from different places can be hidden behind a single `ParameterSource`.

```java
JndiParameterSource jndiParameterSource = new JndiParameterSource();
PropertiesParameterSource propertiesParameterSource = new PropertiesParameterSource("...");

FallbackParameterSource source = jndiParameterSource.withFallback(propertiesParameterSource);
```
Now `source` will look in `jndiParameterSource` first,
and if that does not contain the requested key it will look in `propertiesParameterSource`.

Fallbacks can be chained as much as required.

If you have trouble with different types of keys in these sources,
it might help to use "subSource" to set the path so tight that the keys do not need path separators anymore.

## Stubbing a source for unit testing

`StubStringParameterSource` and `StubObjectParameterSource` are meant for testing purposes.
These return the contained stub value for every key.
Note that conversions will still happen,
so storing a string stub value and requesting an integer will try to convert the string to an integer.

## The project

As this library is focused on scratching one small itch,
it should reach maturity pretty quickly and not require a lot of releases.
Issues and PR's are welcome.
